          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
          the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
          more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h1>About me.</h1>
        <p>
          <span>Me in 3 words: Aggressive, Flexible, Independent.</span>
          <span>
            I am a designer turned developer, turned manager, then turned
            developer again. I love challenging new things and make things
            better, as I did backend (hibernate/spring/JEE) → frontend
            (JSF/php/vuejs) → mobile (both iOS and Android) → manager/architect
            and finally back at what I like the most - mobile development. You
            can say I am like a duck, can do many things but not specialised in
            anything, but that is what I called `flexible`.
          </span>
          <span>
            When it comes to work, I am quite `aggressive` to get thing done.
            Even though that leads to a fight sometimes, but `If you know your
            enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred
            battles. - Sūn Zǐ;`
          </span>
          <span>
            Finally, I love working in a team, and always want to support all my
            team members.
